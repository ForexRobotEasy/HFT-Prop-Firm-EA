## Functionality

### Global Variables

- `challengeTarget`: The target equity value for the prop firm HFT challenge.
- `isChallengeComplete`: A flag that indicates whether the challenge target has been achieved.

### DetectMarketMovements()

This function is responsible for detecting market movements. You can place your code here to implement your own market movement detection strategy.

### StopLossMechanism()

This function implements a stop-loss mechanism to protect equity during market movements. You can customize this function to define your own stop-loss strategy.

### PassHFTChallenge()

This function is used to pass the prop firm HFT challenges. You can implement your own logic to meet the challenge requirements. The function should return `true` if the challenge is passed within an hour, and `false` otherwise.

### EquityProtector()

This function is an integrated equity protector that stops the EA once the challenge target is achieved. If the account equity reaches or exceeds the challenge target, the `isChallengeComplete` flag is set to `true`, and the EA is stopped using the `ExpertRemove()` function.

### MoneyManagementStrategy()

This function implements a robust gain-based money management strategy. You can customize this function to define your own money management rules based on the gains achieved.

### PRMMoneyManagement()

This function implements the Pro Ratio Money Management (PRM) feature. You can place your code here to implement your own PRM strategy.

### OnTick()

This is the main program that runs on every tick. It executes the following steps:
1. Detects market movements.
2. Applies the stop-loss mechanism.
3. Checks if the challenge is complete:
   - If not complete, attempts to pass the HFT challenge.
   - If the challenge is passed, the equity protector is activated, followed by the money management strategy and PRM feature.
